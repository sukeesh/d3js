## Installation

Browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent you from reading files out of the local file system. To develop locally, you must run a local web server rather than using file://…. Node’s http-server is recommended.

To install:

```
npm install -g http-server

```

To run:

```
http-server & 
```

This will start the server on <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080 </a> from the current working directory.

or you can use Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` module.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

```

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed — click the HTML file you want to run.
